**User Story**<br>
As a person planning a visit to a national park, I want to be able to quickly locate park information so that I can plan a trip. End user goal: quickly find park information End business goal: Increase visitation to National Parks  Measurement of success: User is able to find detailed information of parks in less than three mouse clicks.

"Begin Your Adventure" allows a user to find national parks in the state of their choice. The opening page has a text input area for the state name.
Once a state is input, the user is redirected to a page showing cards of all of the national parks in their chosen state. The user then chooses a card and will be redirected to a detail of that park, its amenities, fees and other important information as well as the current weather information.

The project represents the first group project for the five contributors enrolled in the UNC Chapel Hill coding bootcamp fall 2020. We wanted to design a website that would be useful and informational. Information about national parks is vast, our website lets the user get a concise view of a states national parks and its features along with current weather information. The page can be viewed here: https://betterbusinessbrian.github.io/Project-1/


**Accessibility**<br>
The code includes semantic tags that help navigate through the website.

**Things that worked well**<br>
The group was well suited to work with one another because the interest and experience level was evenly divided between front end developers and mid and back end developers. The front end developers all made designs at the start of the project. We then agreed on a format for the website and divided the pages 

**What we would do better next time**<br>
We spent a significant amount of time working out issues with Github. The team would have benefitted from getting some training on working with branches in Github and becoming familiar with the workflow assiciated with working with a group using Github.
